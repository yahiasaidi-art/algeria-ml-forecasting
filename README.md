This repository supports the research paper:  
**"Machine Learning-Based Economic Forecasting in Resource-Constrained Economies: A Case Study of Algeria"**

## ðŸ“„ Overview
This study evaluates five machine learning models â€” Linear Regression, ARIMA, Random Forest, Prophet, and LSTM â€” for forecasting key macroeconomic indicators in Algeria:
- GDP Growth
- Inflation
- Unemployment

Models are trained on 2003â€“2019 data and evaluated on out-of-sample forecasts (2020â€“2023), demonstrating that ML reduces forecasting errors by 25â€“40% compared to traditional methods.
